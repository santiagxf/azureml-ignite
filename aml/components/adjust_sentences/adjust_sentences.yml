  **Adjust sentences lenght**:
  
  Adjusts the lenght of sentences by spliting long sequences of text into shorter ones so they can be processed by models with lenght restrictions. Sentences are split in subsequences of no more than the maximum number of words indicated. You can also indicate an amount of words to bring from the previous subsequence as context in a rolling window fashion.

  For instance, a text containing "the world is that amazing place where everything can happen and there are no limits" can be split in the following considering a `max_words=8` and `words_carry_on=2`:

  1. "the world is that amazing place where everything"
  2. "*where everything* can happen and there are no "
  3. "*are no* limits"

  Where *where everything* and *are no* is context broght from the previous sentence.
